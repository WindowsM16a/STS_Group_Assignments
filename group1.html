      Heyyy, I'm Shayne!, a frontend developer who loves to create responsive, efficient and user-centric websites. My birthday is on the 20<sup>th</sup> of December.
      I'm an interesting person, i can hold an okay conversation about almost any topic you pull up. I love taking pics and videos, I like video games as well, mostly sim racing. 
      Fun fact; I'm actually the highest ranking Ghanaian in <b><i>R3E</i></b> at the moment. I like to read sometimes too. I don't think i need to mention my love for cars at this point haha.
